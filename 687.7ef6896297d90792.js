In this scenario, an electrode serves as the "stick," allowing electricity to pass through it and melt the metal between two components. The electrode is surrounded by a flux coating, and as the electrode heats up during operation, both the flux coating and the electrode melt. This flux coating provides the protection that its name implies; as it melts, it transforms into a shielding gas that repels outside pollutants. Because of the shielding provided by the steadily melting electrode and flux, your project will never be contaminated.Stick welding is especially useful for corroded metals or dirty areas. Furthermore, while this is a versatile process that can be used for a wide range of industrial applications and materials, it is not intended for welding thinner metals and is best suited for thick, significant metals.'),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(14,"h1"),e._uU(15,"Gas Tungsten Arc Welding"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(16,"p"),e._uU(17," Another intricate and difficult type of welding service for industrial fabrication is gas tungsten arc welding, also known as TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding. To avoid contamination, tungsten welding requires an external shielding gas as well as thorough pre-welding cleaning. Unlike most welding techniques, TIG welding does not always necessitate the use of filler material. Welders physically feed a filler rod that matches the base surface material while joining larger metal components with their welding flame. If they are working with thinner, more delicate metals, they can skip the filler. Furthermore, unlike other techniques, the TIG welding electrode does not melt away during welding due to the extremely high melting point of tungsten.TIG welding is difficult to master, but once mastered, it produces smooth, accurate welds. Because of the shorter tungsten electrode and manual filler introduction, a skilled welder has far more control, making this the ideal welding technique for outside areas that must be spotless.
